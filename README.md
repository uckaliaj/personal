If you're reading this; Welcome. 

Some things to note. I am dangerous but generous. 

- 👋 My name is Uke 
- 👀 I’m currently messing around with linux (kali and ubuntu), Bash and Docker.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about reverse engineering, and hacking. Ethically of course. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on multiple projects, focusing on entry-to-mid level positions
- 📫 You can reach me @ bdvccrypto on Elon Musks latest social media acquisition


Congradulations. You have dug into my first repo and managed to read all of it (hopefully) ?
